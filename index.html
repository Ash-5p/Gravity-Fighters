            <p>If you've ever entered a gym in mid-January, it would be easy to think that weightlifting is all bicep
                curls and crunches, but what if I told you there were many styles of weighlifting suited to many
                different goals. We at Gravity Fighters love and embrace all facets of weightlifting and encourage
                everyone, beginner lifter or advanced, to give each one a try!</p>
