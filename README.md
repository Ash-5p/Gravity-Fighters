This project is a static website to promote a weightlifting club called "Gravity Fighters". It will provide advice to people who are interested in getting into the sport, as well as offering suggested workouts and high-protein meal recipes.

At this stage, you should have a name for your project so use it!
Don't introduce the project as a "portfolio project" for the diploma.

In this section, describe what the project hopes to accomplish, who it is intended to target, and how it will be useful to the target audience.

Consider adding a mockup image using the "Am I Responsive" website.
Here's your deployed site as an example:
https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://ash-5p.github.io/Gravity-Fighters

⚠️ NOTE: Issues generating site mockups (Django projects)
This is likely due to security policies with your deployed site.
If you open up your dev tools, there may be an error referencing `X-Frame-Options`.
For Chrome users, head over to http://bit.ly/3iRPn4u and install the extension within your browser.
Once installed, navigate back to the site above.
You should find your site rendering in the various devices.
Alternatively, open your project in Gitpod and run the server.
Once the site is running, click the `Ports` tab at the bottom of your Gitpod workspace (Ports: 2205, 05432, 8000... ).
Click the padlock on port `8000`.
This will make your local page public temporarily.
Now copy the URL of your live-preview page into the responsive tool above.
You should find your site rendering in the various devices.

Screenshots for the README and testing should not be inside of `assets/` or `static/` image folders.
(reminder: `assets/` and `static/` are for files used on the live site, not documentation)
Consider adding a new folder called `documentation`, and add the amiresponsive screenshot inside of that folder.
To add the image into your README, use this format:
(assuming you have a new folder called `documentation` with an image called "mockup.png")

![screenshot](documentation/mockup.png)

Note: Markdown files (.md) should not contain HTML elements like `img`, `br`, `div`, `a`, etc, only Markdown formatting.
Find out more about using Markdown elements here:
https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html

---

GitHub now supports CALLOUTS in Markdown files.
There are some callouts already embedded in this application for you.
However, if you feel that you want to add more, there are certain ones you can use.

NOTE: the preview for callouts isn't yet supported in Gitpod/Codeanywhere/VSCode/etc.
You'll have to commit/push the changes to GitHub to see it in action.

## UX

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

In this section, you will briefly explain your design processes.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

### Colour Scheme

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Explain your colours and the colour scheme.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

- `#000000` used for primary text.
- `#E84610` used for primary highlights.
- `#4A4A4F` used for secondary text.
- `#009FE3` used for secondary highlights.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Consider adding a link and screenshot for your colour scheme using "coolors".
https://coolors.co/generate

When you add a colour to the palette, the URL is dynamically updated, making it easier for you to return back to your colour palette later if needed.

Example:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/e84610-009fe3-4a4a4f-445261-d63649-e6ecf0-000000) to generate my colour palette.

![screenshot](documentation/coolors.png)

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

⚠️ ONLY IF YOU ACTUALLY ADDED `:root` variables in CSS! ⚠️
If you've used CSS `:root` variables, consider also including a code snippet here!

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

I've used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
:root {
    /* P = Primary | S = Secondary */
    --p-text: #000000;
    --p-highlight: #E84610;
    --s-text: #4A4A4F;
    --s-highlight: #009FE3;
    --white: #FFFFFF;
    --black: #000000;
}
```

### Typography

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Explain any fonts and icon libraries used, like Google Fonts and/or Font Awesome.

Consider adding a link to each font used, and the Font Awesome site if used (or similar icon library).

Example:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Features

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project,
and describe each in a sentence or so.

You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user,
focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve,
and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

IMPORTANT: Remember to always include a screenshot of each individual feature!

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)
